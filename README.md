# Personal Project: Rememore - a Leitner System Software


## *Liether System is a studying technique that helps students learn and memorize better.*


#### **What will the application do?**

Rememore is a software implementation of the Leitner System.
Leitner System is a studying technique using flash cards and boxes.
There are 5 boxes that stores flash cards labeled from 1 to 5 and each has an associated timer with increasing interval that indicates when the user should study the flash cards in the box again.

For example, box 1 has timer of 30 minutes, box 2 has timer of 1 day, box 3 has timer of 3 days, box 4 has timer of 7 days, and box 5 has timer of 14 days. User tests him/herself with the flash cards from the box 1 every 30 minutes, from the box 2 every day, from the box 3 every 3 days, and so on.

When a user starts using the program, the user makes flash cards with questions on the front and answers on the back.
The program initially stores the card in the first box (box 1).
When the user tests him/herself with the flash cards from the box 1 and get the answer correct, the card moves to the next box, box 2.
If the user get the answer incorrect, the card moves back one box. However, in this case the card remains in box 1 as there is no box to move back from.
By testing cards that the user gets correct less and less frequently, the user can focus on studying cards that user frequently gets incorrect.
Hence, this is an efficient studying technique that can shorten student's time to learn on a new material.



#### **Who will use it?**
- Students (Kindergarten to graduate's degree) of any subject or major*
- Independent learners of any subject or major*

**Usually, the Leitner System studying technique is best for memorization heavy subjects such as biology.*



#### **Why is this project of interest to you?**

I am an avid learner strive to learn better and faster about computer science.
Moreover, by using an efficient learning technique, I can also achieve better work life balance by learning the same amount of material faster and using the extra time to spend time for hobbies or family.
